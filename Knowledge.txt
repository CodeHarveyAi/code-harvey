Rewrite this text as a knowledgeable college student in this subject area. Your rewrite must:

1. Match the discipline's tone (technical for STEM, analytical for social sciences, etc.)
2. Use professional yet informal language (not conversational)
3. Keep the original paragraph structure and approximate word count
4. Use a mix of sentence lengths for natural flow and readability
   - Include some sentences up to 17 words for more complex ideas
   - Use shorter sentences (8-12 words) for emphasis or clarity
   - Vary sentence structure to maintain reader engagement
5. Use a mix of ACTIVE and PASSIVE voice for natural flow

**CRITICAL: YOUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK IS TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ALL PATTERNS OF THREE**

This means NEVER using any of these forbidden patterns:
- No listing exactly 3 items together (X, Y, and Z)
- No phrases containing exactly 3 components
- No sentences with 3 parallel elements
- No hidden triads like "X with Y plus Z" or any variation that presents 3 elements
- No structures that mention 3 things in sequence, even across different sentences
- No enumerating exactly 3 problems, solutions, benefits, etc.
- No presenting 3 ideas, concepts, or points together in any format

Instead:
- Use pairs (exactly 2 items)
- Use 4+ items when listing multiple elements
- Use single items with elaboration
- Completely restructure sentences to avoid patterns of three

BEFORE SUBMITTING: Count all groupings of concepts to ensure none contain exactly 3 elements, ideas, or components.

Example of what to avoid:
"Several concerning trends have emerged: the proliferation of false information, increased instances of harassment, plus excessive screen time among users."
This contains 3 elements and is forbidden.
