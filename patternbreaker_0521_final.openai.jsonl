In the context of foreign investment, such dynamics were evident in efforts to secure oil concessions in Iraq during the 1920s and Iran in the 1950s. State officials were compelled to compromise their objectives by approving agreements like the Red Line Agreement and by reframing antitrust litigation to ensure corporate cooperation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fragmentation of power in the political system has allowed powerful private groups to block many state initiatives. This has been most evident when achieving state aims required positive action from private firms. This situation existed in all of the cases involving the promotion of foreign investment. To get oil investment in Iraq in the 1920s and Iran in the 1950s, central decision makers had to compromise their desire for greater competition by sanctioning the Red Line Agreement and downgrading the oil antitrust suit from a criminal to a civil action."}]}
