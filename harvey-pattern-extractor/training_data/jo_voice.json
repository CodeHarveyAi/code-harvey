Yet, the processes are associated with activities that are contrary to the principles of natural justice. Medical researchers utilize AI systems to gather data such as age, and level of disease seriousness, among others (Kumar et al., 2022). Although the data collected helps patients, consent and data privacy are of significant concern (Price & Cohen, 2019). Consent involves a voluntary agreement to the proposal and desires of another person. Many AI systems in the healthcare environment utilize patients’ data and information without their permission."

Conversely, platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat have remained highly popular among youth and young adults, emphasizing their role in digital identity formation. Unlike traditional media, social media allows users to actively curate and engage with content, creating a dynamic and participatory environment. This has raised questions regarding its potential impact on interpersonal relationships, including increased risks of isolation and diminished empathy. Moreover, excessive engagement with these platforms has been linked to more serious mental health concerns, including suicidal ideation. While many scholars argue that social media significantly influences mental health, the authors challenge this perspective, referencing a statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding “Facebook Depression”—a claim ultimately undermined by unreliable sources and misinformation."

On the other hand, it also mentions the popularity of social media in the youth and young adults. “social media use is an important element of the developmental process for youth and young adults as they interact with others and present their forming identities online” The authors mention’s, “unlike more traditional media, users play an active role in creating and shaping the experience.” This brings a great deal of concern for many because young people are highly invested in using apps like Facebook, YouTube, snapchat, etc. This brings a great deal of questions such as social media affecting real life interactions that could lead to loneliness or isolation. Subsequent, they question if social media could cause problems with close contact and cause a lack of empathy. Ultimately, they question if the excessive use of social media could cause suicidal ideation. While many claims that social media does influence mental health, the authors were quick to shut this argument down. This claim was supported by a report done by the “American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) who claimed “Facebook Depression” could develop among youth who used social media too long” when they revealed they had based their data on fake news."

Early on, Watson advocated for the inclusion of Black voters, aligning with agrarian interests and seeking to garner support from Black farmers. However, by 1892, his efforts as an inclusive populist began to falter. Facing political decline, Watson shifted his views, ultimately abandoning his earlier support for racial inclusivity in pursuit of electoral success.

However, this perspective overlooks the broader issue of gun accessibility in the United States.

This statement is not only wrong, but it also does not change the fact that the problem would not even exist if both, the \"good guy\" and \"the bad guy\" didn't have access to guns in the first place. The laws on gun control make it too easy for people to own guns. Even more troubling is the fact that a lot of convicted criminals have access to guns. The easy access and the fact that most mass shootings occur in places that people think are \"gun free zones\" should be enough to stop and rethink gun control laws. The only thing that could help in situations like these is to make sure people can't buy guns so easily. The government needs to make it tough to own firearms."
